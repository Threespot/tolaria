The Tolaria maintainers welcome contributions. While contributing, you shall adhere to the project [code of conduct](#the-code-of-conduct), so that everyone feels welcome.

**An up-front apology:** Tolaria is not necessarily the maintainers' full-time gig. Please be patient with us getting back to you.

If you'd like to help make Tolaria better, here's how you can:

  - Use prerelease versions (`gem install tolaria --pre`)
  - [Report an issue](https://github.com/threespot/tolaria/issues/new) or ask questions
  - [Suggest new features](https://github.com/threespot/tolaria/issues/new)
  - Checking, vetting, diagnosing, or adding details to existing issues.
  - Contributing or improving documentation. We're sure there are still typos or unclear instructions. These are easy wins.
  - Contributing pull requests or bugfixes.

Thanks for helping us make Tolaria better!

### The Code of Conduct

The Tolaria project strongly values contributors from anywhere, regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, age, or religion. As a result, the maintainers have agreed to and enforces this code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in the development of Tolaria.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, age, or religion. It also includes the posting of sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Further, harassment includes ad-hominem attacks, grandstanding, derogatory comments, trolling, public or private community disruption, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Harassment is not tolerated in our issue tracker, code, events, chat channels, over emails, or any other way you can communicate with a contributor. Anyone who is asked to cease harassment is expected to comply immediately. Maintainers are not exempt from this policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the projectâ€™s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please open an issue or contact a maintainer.
