The Tolaria maintainers welcome contributions. While contributing, you shall adhere to the project [code of conduct](http://bundler.io/conduct.html) below, so that everyone feels welcome.

**An up-front apology:** Tolaria is not necessarily the maintainers' full-time gig. Please be patient with us getting back to you.

If you'd like to help make Tolaria better, here's how you can help:

  - Use prerelease versions (`gem install tolaria --pre`)
  - [Report an issue](https://github.com/threespot/tolaria/issues/new) or ask questions
  - [Suggest new features](https://github.com/threespot/tolaria/issues/new)
  - Checking, vetting, diagnosing, or adding details to existing issues.
  - Contributing or improving documentation. We're sure there are still language typos or unclear instructions. These are easy wins.

Thanks for helping us make Tolaria better!

### The Code of Conduct

The Tolaria project strongly values contributors from anywhere, regardless of gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, or religion. As a result, the team has agreed to and enforces this code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in the development of Tolaria. Maintainers are not exempt from this policy.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, religion. It also includes the posting of sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Further, harassment includes sustained community disruption, ad-hominem attacks, grandstanding, and "holy war" debates.

Harassment is not tolerated in our issue tracker, code, events, chat channels, over emails, or any other way you can communicate with a contributor. Anyone who is asked to cease harassment is expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the projectâ€™s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the core team.
